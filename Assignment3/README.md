## Distributed System Principle Assignment 3
==========================
#### Author: Team 2

**Abstract:**

In this assignment, a pub/sub network is established via Mininet and ZeroMQ. 
Zookeeper is utilized to manage broker nodes. As assignment 1,
two topologies, namely star topology and bus topology, are implemented but there are three broker nodes (it can be more by set the broker node number). 
Multiple publishers and subscribers with various topics can be added into or removed from the network. 
Finally, end-to-end measurements are carried out and the time difference is measured.

**Introduction:**

Mininet is a software emulator for prototyping a large network on a single machine. 
Mininet can be used to quickly create a realistic virtual network running actual kernel, switch and software application code on a personal computer. 
Mininet allows the user to quickly create, interact with, customize and share a software-defined network (SDN) prototype to simulate a network topology that uses Openï¬‚ow switches [1]. 

Apache ZooKeeper is a software project of the Apache Software Foundation. 
It is essentially a centralized service for distributed systems to a hierarchical key-value store, 
which is used to provide a distributed configuration service, synchronization service, and naming registry for large distributed systems. 
ZooKeeper was a sub-project of Hadoop but is now a top-level Apache project in its own right. 
ZooKeeper's architecture supports high availability through redundant services [2].

In this assignment, zookeeper is used to coordinate the broker nodes and carry out the leader election 
when one of brokers is disconnected. In the non-broker mode, the zookeeper's watch mechanism is utilized for 
subscribers to obtain data from publishers.

**Create Network Topologies**

***Star Topology Network***

In this assignment, star topology and bus topology are created. 
Using python file StarTopologyZK.py, a star topology 
(in default case, there will be three publishers, three brokers and three subscribers). 
The command to construct a star topology with broker is: 
       
   ```bash 
     sudo mn --custom StarTopologyZK.py --topo startopoZK
   ```

***Bus Topology Network***

 The command to construct a star topology with broker is: 
 
 ```bash 
     sudo mn --custom BusTopologyZK.py --topo bustopoZK
 ```
 

**Pub/Sub System on Star Topology**

***Zookeeper***

Zookeeper is embeded inside the python scripts, namely ZMQ_broker.py, ZMQ_publisher.py, ZMQ_subscriber.py 
They are executed in the command line interface. The version of zookeeper used in this assignment is kazoo 2.6.1.

**Testing Procedure**

***Broker Mode***

First we use Mininet to create a topology. The command can be found above. Here we choose star topology 
(one may also use the bus topology). The result is shown in Fig 1.

##### Fig 1 A Star Topology in Mininet

Before testing, we need to start the zookeeper server first. We xterm the first broker, broker1. 
Then we change the directory to the _bin/_ folder of zookeeper (in this case, it is at ~/Documents).
Use command:

 ```bash 
     ./zkServer.sh start
 ```
to start the zookeeper server.

**Note:** This step is critical otherwise brokers cannot connect the zookeeper server. There will be a 
**Connection dropped: socket connection error: Connection refused** ERROR.

The successful result is as Fig 2.

##### Fig 2 Start the Zookeeper Server

Then we navigate back to our assignment folder. 
First we run the scripts on three brokers as shown in Fig 3. The format is as follows:

 ```bash 
     sudo python3 ZMQ_broker.py <broker ID> <IP of zookeeper server> <IP of itself>
 ```
 
 ![StartBrokersBM](./Pictures/startBrokerBM.jpg)

##### Fig 3 Start the Zookeepers

We can see that broker1 becomes the leader broker and broker2 and broker3 is watching.
Then we can start the publishers and subscribers.

xterm all publishers and subscribers. The command format for publishers is 


 ```bash 
     sudo python3 ZMQ_publisher.py <IP of zookeeper server> <publisher ID> <Topic>
 ```
 The command format for subscribers is 


 ```bash 
     sudo python3 ZMQ_subscriber.py <IP of zookeeper server> <subscriber ID> <Topic>
 ```
 The result of running publishers and subscribers are shown in Fig 4 and Fig 5 respectively.

***Broker Election***

One of signifocant features of zookeeper is its election mechanism. The result is illustrated in Fig 5.

  ![brokerElectionBM](./Pictures/brokerElection.jpg)

##### Fig 5 Broker Election

Here, we do DataWatch 
on the broker leader. If it is down, an election is carried out to select a new leader broker.
We use keyboard interrupt to terminate broker1, the current leader and
 the new leader broker, broker3 is elected as the new broker. In this case, the data transmission can be continued.
 
**Non-Broker Mode**

To build a non-broker mode network, we use BusTopologyNB.py and StarTopologyNB.py from assignment 1.
The command to build a non-broker bus-topology network is:

 ```bash 
     sudo mn --custom BusTopologyNB.py --topo bustopoNB
 ```

For non-broker star-topology network, the command is:
 ```bash 
     sudo mn --custom StarTopologyNB.py --topo startopoNB
 ```

Then we xterm each publisher and subscriber. In pub1, we first start the zookeeper server in pub1.

We change the directory to the _/bin/_ folder of zookeeper (in this case, it is at ~/Documents).
Use command:

 ```bash 
     ./zkServer.sh start
 ```

Then we navigate the directory back and run the publisher's script. The publisher code for non-broker mode is ZMQ_publisher_NB.py

The command is:

 ```bash 
     sudo python3 ZMQ_publisher_NB <zookeeper IP> <publisher ID> <Topic> <its own IP>
 ```
 
 The running publishers are shown in Fig 6.

Then we started all the subscribers (shown in Fig 7).

***Note:*** the network may require some time to get connected. 
Please try several times for the scripts.

**Latency Measurement**

The latency measurement is also carried out in this assignment.

For bus topology, the latency is shown in Fig 8.

 ![busTopoLatency](./Pictures/BTZKSubscriber2.png)
 ##### Fig 8 The Latency Measurement in Bus Topology
 
 It shows that at first, it suffers a huge latency and later become stable.
 
 For star topology, the latency is shown in Fig 9.

 ##### Fig 9 The Latency Measurement in Bus Topology

Its latency pattern is similar to the bus topology.

**Effort of Teammates**
In this assignment, we collaboratively finish all the work. 
Ziran is responsible for embedding the kazoo code inside the broker script and set up watch mechanism for znodes.
Xiaoxing modified the Mininet script for new topologies and set up zookeeper file system.
Robert is for childrenWatch mechanism testing and latency measurement.
